# Student Performance Prediction


## Overview
This project predicts student academic performance (pass/fail) based on multiple socio-academic factors such as study time, absences, and parental education.  
It uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** trained on the [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).

## Dataset
UCI Student Performance dataset:
- `student-mat.csv` → Mathematics students  
- `student-por.csv` → Portuguese students
